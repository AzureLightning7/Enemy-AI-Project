# Enemy-AI-Project
Project files for a Unity personal project focused on learning Enemy AI behavior and pathing

Requires Unity version 2018.3.8f1

WASD to move, Left click or Left Ctrl to shoot, Space to jump, and Left Shift to Sprint

Enemy ship will continuously target and move towards the player until it is shot and killed by a rocket, and once it touches the player, it will end the game.

Player controlled character is mostly a troll (hence buggy physics and silly explosion sound) as the focus of this project is the enemy pathing.
